# SHOPPING RUN

## Description 
Shopping Run is a shopping list application. 

I created the app because I found that in the area I live, we visit multiple stores nearby for different items to get the best price. We have Coles, Adli and a Grocery Store walking distance from our house. We have found that we visit all 3 shops, as they have certain items cheaper than other. 

For examples, we get all our vegetables and fruits from the Grocery Store, toilet paper and olive oil from Alid, and use Coles to get whatever we can't get from the other two stores. 

The Shopping Run app allows you to add items to your shopping list and select the store you want to purchase the item from.
